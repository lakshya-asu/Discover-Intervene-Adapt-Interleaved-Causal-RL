# Discover-Intervene-Adapt (DIA)

## Project Goals
- Develop causal reinforcement learning agents capable of interleaved discovery, intervention, and adaptation across complex environments.
- Provide a modular research codebase that accelerates experimentation with novel causal discovery and policy learning algorithms.
- Enable reproducible experimentation workflows, from synthetic benchmarks to real-world-inspired domains.
